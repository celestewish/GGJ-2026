EVERYTHING EXCEPT FOR BUTTONS (and two things with frames) ARE TURNED INTO PNGS!

The buttons are animated and Unity Package Manager has a package called 'Aseprite Importer Package' to specifically work with .ase files. This is the way I intended for the buttons to be put into Unity.

FOLDER INFORMATION:
- Masks -> .ase files of the masks.
- BaseSprites -> Just contains some of the base images for the character sprites.
- Trickster -> Contains the sprites for the Trickster character.
- MusicMan -> Contains the sprites for the Music Man character.
- LawMan -> Contains the sprites for the Law Man character.
- DrunkMan -> Contains the sprites for the Drunk man character.
- UI -> Contains all the UI art I've done. Separated by folders.

UI FOLDER INFORMATION:
- Settings Screen -> All UI art that can be used in the Setting Screen.
- Selection Screen -> All UI art that can be used in the screen where players are picking their mask.
- Game Screen -> All UI art that can be used in the actually main game screen.
- Main Screen -> All UI art that can be used in the main menu screen.
